As a result of a certain experiment, the following data array was obtained:
[1.1066, 1.1048, 1.1023, 1.1003, 1.0969, 1.0951, 1.0901, 1.0914, 1.0867, 1.0842, 1.0835, 1.0816, 1.08,
1.079, 1.0801, 1.0818, 1.084, 1.0875, 1.0964, 1.0977, 1.1122, 1.1117, 1.1125, 1.1187, 1.1336, 1.1456,
1.139, 1.1336, 1.124, 1.1104, 1.1157, 1.0982, 1.0934, 1.0801, 1.0707, 1.0783, 1.0843, 1.0827, 1.0981,
1.0977, 1.1034, 1.0956, 1.0936, 1.0906, 1.0785, 1.0791, 1.0885, 1.0871, 1.0867, 1.0963]
The researcher wants to analyze the data visually, for which he needs to see
details of changes in the values ​ ​ on the graph. Your task is to write a console script,
displaying each point of the graph as a separate line so that the changes are
visually noticeable. The solution must work for any dataset. For simplification
the width of the terminal window can be assumed to be 80 characters.
